# The Frog Collector

This simple and fun application demonstrates full CRUD capability and features a model-view-controller architecture. It was built with Python and Django.

This was a group project. I was the backend developer and built out the router, model, views and controllers in Python. My partner focused on CSS styling and the photos.

A green palette was chosen to complement the subject matter, which is frogs. The Google font selected was Amatic SC, which provides a fun, playful look to the website.
